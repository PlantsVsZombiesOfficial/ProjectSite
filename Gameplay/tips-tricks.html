                    <li><p><B> Planning out your sunflowers</B> Sunflowers are the power of this game.
                             If you have too few sunflowers you won't be able to afford enough of the right
                             plants to defend your lawn from the zombies who want to "eat your brainz". 
                             Sunflowers are your primary concern when you start the level. Plant two rows
                             of sunflowers in the back of your lawn where they are mostly pretty protected. 
                             Then, when the first zombie enters the screen, plant the single pea shooter 3.5 
                             squares away from the first zombie. This pea shooter will kill the zombie just 
                             before it eats your plant, maximizing your time. Then keep planting sunflowers 
                             until the next zombie enters the screen. Repeat until all two rows of sunflowers 
                             are planted.

                    <!-- TIP 2 -->
                    <li><p><B> Check which zombies are coming before you select your plants</B> Before you start the level 
                         you get a glimpse at which zombies will attack on that level. That lets you know the proper 
                         plants to choose for that level. There are some zombies which are only beaten by certain 
                         plants, such, as the bungee zombie, and you want to make sure you have the right plant, 
                         like canopy plant, to stop them dead(er).

                    </li>

                    <!-- TIP 3 -->
                    <li><p><B>Check your almanac</B> After you have encountered a zombie it is added to your almanac. So if ever 
                        you forget how to defeat one of the zombies you can just take a look at the almanac for its 
                        weaknesses and special quirks. You can do this before you have selected your plants, which 
                        will make sure you are not left defenceless.

                    </li>

                    <!-- TIP 4 -->
                    <li><p><B>Farm the Yeti to earn money more quickly</B> The yeti zombie is cute yet reclusive. He is only 
                        found on one level (4-10) and only after you have completed the levels once in full, and then gone 
                        back to complete them again. However, you can use the second time to farm the yeti and get three diamonds. 
                        If you dont see the yeti zombie in the preview restart the game a second time or kill the game in the task 
                        bar. The yeti zombie will run if he takes too much damage so always make sure to put some plants behind him 
                        to slow his escape. You can keep farming him for as long as you want with this method, just don't pass the 
                        level. (Apologies for the fog in the picture it is hard to take pictures during a lightning storm!).

                    </li>

                    <!-- TIP 5 -->
                    <li><p><B>Getting Zen Garden plants</B> Make sure that you have at least one spot open in your main zen garden for 
                        the new plant to be placed. If it gets filled up when one drops in a game, exit the game and sell another 
                        plant so you have a spot free in case another drops. Make sure you also have 10 chocolates. There's nothing 
                        worse than getting a drop of chocolate instead of a plant. The fastest way is through the bonus games. I like 
                        whack-a-zombie since it is fast and there is a chance each time you chew up a grave as well.

                    <!-- TIP 6 -->
                    <li><p><B>Play "Last Stand" to make more money fast.</B> Play the mini game "Last Stand" to earn even more quick cash. 
                        The best part of earning money this way is that after the set up you can just let the game play itself out 
                        without worry, as you don't have to care if you pass the level or not. The golden magnets will collect the gold 
                        for you and you can earn about 5k in two of the 5 flags.

                    <!-- TIP 7 -->
                    <li><p><B>Grow your plants immediately</B> If you don't feel like waiting on your plants to grow or if Crazy Dave's Shop 
                        is fully sold out of items which respawn the next day, you can move time forward. Using this trick you will replenish 
                        in moments instead of days. The first thing you do is make sure your plants are fully watered and fed for the day. 
                        Then leave the application. Next double click the home button to open the task bar and press the minus button kill 
                        the application. Then Settings > General > Date & Time > Set Automatically > Off > Move day one ahead. Exit and go 
                        back to your game with your plants will have grown up before your eyes. Repeat the same steps for putting the time 
                        back. Make sure to kill the application before you move the time ahead.

                    <!-- TIP 8 -->
                    <li><p><B>Use the umbrella leaf sparingly</B> The umbrella leaf plant will make your time on the roof much more relaxing, 
                        as it protects your plants from the bungee zombie. The bungee zombie will steal any plants it targets. You only need 
                        4 umbrella leaf plants to protect almost the whole screen, as each one defends a 3 by 3 square.

                    <!-- TIP 9 -->
                    <li><p><B>Cat of nine tails</B> If you are playing a level in the pool, the cat of nine tails is just about the only attack you 
                        really need. They are really exceptionally efficient as they always go after the zombie which is closest to your home and 
                        will shoot down balloon zombies as well. They also shoot guided arrows to anywhere on screen so you dont need to worry about 
                        which row they are in or if the attack is behind or in front of them. (The zomboni zombie may need some spike weed though.)

                    <!-- TIP 10 -->
                    <li><p><B>Finding water plants</B> In order to find a water plant you need to be on a water level. That does not mean that each 
                        spawn will be a water plant though, but it does add water plants to the selection chances.
